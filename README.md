## Part1
Part1 inlcudes these files:
* board.py
* player.py
* human.py
* computer.py
* main.py
* Part1.md

In Part1.md, I explained my code.

The board.py, player.py,human.py,computer.py are all classes, and the main.py is the main code for running.

***Remember that the class files should be stored in the same path as the main file.***

You can run it in **Spyder**.

## Part2
Part2 includes:
* Part2.ipynb

You can run it in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Part3
Part3 includes:
* Part3.ipynb
* data.csv
* worldmap.html

The collected data saved in data.csv. And you can run Part3.ipynb in **Jupyter Notebook**.

**Because I crawling the datasets from the webset "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" in ***December 28, 2021***. So you'd better start the code from Step2:**

  '''
  df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
  '''

**Otherwise, you may get different output and conlusion from mine.**

**In Q2, I generated a photo in html format.**

You can download the worldmap.html in the github, and open it in any browser.
